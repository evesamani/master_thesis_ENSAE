Master's thesis under the supervision of **Frank Malherbet (CREST - ENSAE)** on the Bonus-Malus system in unemployment insurance. 

This research aims to analyze the theoretical foundations of the experience rating mechanism as developed in the U.S. literature while assessing the limitations of the model and the specificities of its recent implementation in France. By comparing both frameworks, we seek to highlight key economic trade-offs and potential adjustments that could improve the effectiveness of this policy in the French labor market.

This thesis is part of the "Reading Group in Economics and Sociology" course (Spring 2025, ENSAE Paris).
